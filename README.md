You can check the deployed mockup front [here](https://deploycartridgevalley20-production.up.railway.app/)

## Tecnologies and libraries used

### Express

Express is a node js web application framework that provides broad features for building web and mobile applications. I've used Express as the base for my API REST. It helps a ton with routing and http helpers.

### MongoDB

MongoDB Atlas' document model enables developers to store data as JSON-like objects that resemble objects in application code. This is the main database with all the info regarding products, carts, users, and everything else that needs storing!

### Bootstrap

Without this awesome toolkit it'd have taken me years to design and implement all the components of the website. This library gave me the right tools for this project front-end mockup.

### Socket.io

Socket.IO is a library that enables low-latency, bidirectional and event-based communication between a client and a server. This is primordial to make features such as the chat work!

### SwaggerUI

OpenAPI Specification (formerly Swagger Specification) is an API description format for REST APIs. It allowed me to describe my entire API with testeable endpoints, easy to understand interface and auth capabilities.
